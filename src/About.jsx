                Hey there! My name is Nguyen, I am a current sophomore at the University of Central Florida. I am taking my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a lean towards machine learning/deep learning. I was originally a Video Game Developer because I love playing them and building things with a visual reward. Although my focus has shifted toward AI and machine learning, I still enjoy playing video games and occasionally creating them. Additionally, I also spend a lot of time listening to music; my favourites are restrospective, chill, melancholic, and folk music. My favourite artist is Gregory Alan Isakov. Check out my playlist below!                 </p>
